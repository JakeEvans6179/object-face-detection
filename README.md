# object-face-detection
Testing yolo object detection for later implementation in raspberry pi5

custom.py runs 2dog_onehuman_test.pt model which is yolov11n model trained on custom dataset.
Yolov11n cannot differentiate between different faces well but can tell the difference between 2 dogs with reasonable accuracy. 

If wanting to carry out facial recognition on raspberry pi5, an alternative method will be required such as face_recognition package.
